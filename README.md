# Precipitation Measurement - satellite and ground-based
Specifically compare between ground stations and GPM/TRMM data:

- annual precipitation
- daily precipitation mean and standard deviation
-- wet season
-- dry season

GPM/TRMM temporal and spatial resolution:

> "For our popular multi-satellite GPM IMERG data products, the spatial resolution is 0.1° x 0.1° (or roughly 10km x 10km) with a 30 minute temporal resolution."
